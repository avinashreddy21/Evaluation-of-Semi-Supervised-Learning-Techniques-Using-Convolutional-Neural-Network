# Evaluation-of-Semi-Supervised-Learning-Techniques-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Network

Semi-supervised learning is a combination of supervised
and unsupervised learning which makes use of unlabeled
data along with small amount of labeled data for training
of a machine learning model. In this paper, we test and
compare classification accuracies, confusion matrices and
plot loss function of the following semi-supervised learning
algorithms, viz.: Entropy Minimization, CutMix, MixUp
using convolutional neural network. We analyze and report
the performance by applying all the three techniques
together and by varying the number of labelled and
unlabeled samples for each technique using CIFAR 10
dataset.
